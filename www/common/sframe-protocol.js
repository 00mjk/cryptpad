// This file defines all of the RPC calls which are used between the inner and outer iframe.
// Define *querys* (which expect a response) using Q_<query name>
// Define *events* (which expect no response) using EV_<event name>
// Please document the queries and events you create, and please please avoid making generic
// "do stuff" events/queries which are used for many different things because it makes the
// protocol unclear.

// WARNING: At this point, this protocol is still EXPERIMENTAL. This is not it's final form.
//   We need to define protocol one piece at a time and then when we are satisfied that we
//   fully understand the problem, we will define the *right* protocol and this file will be dynomited.
